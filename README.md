Fitness Tracker App

MetaTr@cker is a fitness tracking mobile application that enables the user to keep records of their fitness stats in an organized manner. 

Nowadays due to the Corona outbreak, it is difficult to go to the gym for our regular workout with the restricted movement control order in place. 

Trainers and gym enthusiasts are in need to track their own workout regime, but the gym is off limits. Trainees are unable to customize their own training regime according to their preference and keep track of their physical fitness, BMI, calories burned as well as FFMI. Apps that are featured in the play store always come with in purchases for premium features which is inconvenient to some. 

The approach we came up with in regards to solving this issue is to create a dedicated fitness tracking app that is designed to track a user training regime and record their progress, session by session on a daily basis. This app will be user-friendly and completely free to use without any ads since it's a community service. The platform weâ€™re using to market this app is via Google Play Store. The app will be created by using Java source code. 

Benefits of this app are, users can use this application to track their fitness progress and do exercises from the comfort of their own homes during this corona time. Trainers and trainees may use this app to keep track of their weight, fat, muscles, water limit, size, BMI, and FFMI and maintain track of their weight, fat, muscles, and water limit. Furthermore, they may monitor the growth of their biceps, chest, waist, hips, and both thighs at any time.
